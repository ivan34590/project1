        <p>The Ybycui National Park is a protected area that contains a dense rainforest that was once part of the Atlantic rainforest. It contains steep hills with a relatively small area of 400 meters when compared to other parks. Although small on the surface, it is a diverse ecosystem with plenty of different areas to explore.
        </p>
        <p>At the park there is an old iron foundry that has been turned into a museum. It was originally used to forge weapons during wars but now instead shows off the old weaponry it crafted as well as other pieces of historice importance.
        </p>
        <p>There are also many trails a person can hike and explore while being able to see the beautiful scenery such as waterfalls and raging rivers.</p>
